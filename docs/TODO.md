Add an extra option for velocity model that we can use in the time to depth migration
- [X] Add .dat file in the repo
- [X] File is larger than 100MB (figure out a way around this) - store it as an .npz file
- [X] Write a function that reads the model (lon, lat, dep, Vp and Vs)
- [ ] **Test function**
- [ ] **Run tests with sample dataset**
