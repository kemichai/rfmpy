Receiver functions and time-to-depth migration calculations

``rfmpy`` calculates **receiver function (RF) and perform time to depth migration** for mapping
the **Moho** discontinuity (boundary between the Earth's crust and mantle),
in a 3D spherical coordinate system.

We used these codes to create a new Moho depth map for the broader European
Alpine region, based on four temporary seismic networks (i.e., AASN, EASI, CIFALPS, PACASE). For a few more details
on this project, have a look at our publication `Michailos et al., 2023 <https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/2117/2023/essd-15-2117-2023.html>`__.
The receiver function dataset, we use in this publication above is also open-access and can be downloaded from the
following `Zenodo repository <https://zenodo.org/record/7695125>`_.

The codes are actively developed on `GitHub <https://github.com/kemichai/rfmpy/>`_.

üÜï **Application to map the Mantle-Transition-Zone**

More recently we have expanded the applicability of ``rfmpy`` in order to map the
mantle transition zone (MTZ, 410 km, 520 km, and 660 km discontinuities). This project, led
by D. Kalm√°r, aims to map the MTZ beneath Central and Eastern Europe to better understand
active tectonic and geodynamic processes.
