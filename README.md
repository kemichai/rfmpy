Welcome to the *rfmpy* repository! 
------------
The codes found here calculate receiver function (RF) and 
perform time to depth migration, in a 3D spherical coordinate system. 

![My Image](docs/images/RFM_logo_alt.png)

We use these codes examine the Moho depth variations for the broader European
Alpine region, based on four temporary seismic networks (i.e., AASN, EASI, CIFALPS, PACASE).
For more details on this project, have a look at our 
[paper](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/15/2117/2023/essd-15-2117-2023.html) entitled _‚ÄúMoho depths beneath the European Alps: a homogeneously processed map and receiver functions database‚Äù_, 
published at Earth System Science Data (ESSD). The receiver function dataset, used in this project
is **open access** and can be found the following [Zenodo repository](https://zenodo.org/record/7695125).

## üÜï Application to map the Mantle-Transition-Zone 
This is a project led by DK who investigates the mantle transition zone beneath Central and Eastern Europe using
seismic data from a number of temporary and permanents seismic networks in the region. 
DK, LP, GH and KM developed a new version of rfmpy to apply it for the study of the MTZ.
An example of this application is available in the documentation.

‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
------------
Please note that, at least at this stage, the codes are designed to reproduce our results.
For different applications the codes will need to be modified.

The codes are currently at development and are subject to 
change at any time. We welcome any code improvements or suggestions 
and error reports from the community.
