Description 
------------
Python codes to calculate receiver function (RF) and 
perform time to depth migration, in a 3D spherical coordinate system. 

We use these codes to estimate new profiles and a new Moho depth map for the broader European
Alpine region, based on four temporary seismic networks (i.e., AASN, EASI, CIFALPS, PACASE).
For a few more details on this project have a look at our [EGU 2022 abstract](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU22/EGU22-8174.html).

We are currently preparing a manuscript draft entitled: 
_"Moho depths beneath the European Alps:a homogeneously processed map and receiver functions database"_
to be submitted to _Earth System Science Data (ESSD)_.

A *tutorial* for calculating RFs and time-to-depth migrations for a
subset of seismic data is available in the documentation.

Notes
------------
Please note that, at least at this stage, the codes are designed to reproduce our results.
For different applications the codes will need to be modified.

The codes are currently at development and are subject to 
change at any time. We welcome any code improvements or suggestions 
and error reports from the community.
