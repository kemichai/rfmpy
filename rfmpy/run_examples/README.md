###Notes on quality control for RFs c1-c4
___

See qc.eps, on the X axis is the value of C1, C2, C3 C4
parameters, the vertical axis the ratio of waveforms passing through the
criteria at that value.

So with C1 and C2, which is the band around the median rms of all
stations for a given event, the higher the threshold, the more data goes
through.

C3 and C4, on impulsiveness if you want, are the opposite, the higher
the value, the stricter the criteria.

Often there are waveforms that pass through some of these criteria but
not all, these are also discarded. In other words, being moderately
strict on all of these criteria can still mean that few waveforms pass
through as they have to satisfy all of these conditions simultaneously.

QC_c1c2c3c4_parameters shows the table from GH's thesis.
