### Tests
- [X] Test for all available data within 30 days took ~28 minutes (first 30 days of 2016).

### Todo
- [X] Check that modified codes give same results with Matteo's codes 
- [X] Check that our codes give similar results with Matlab codes 
- [X] Write code for manually picking Moho depths from migrated cross-sections. Modify so 
picks are made by pressing a button and not by clicking. Assing two types of
picks (i.e., one for Moho and one for uncertain moho)
- [ ] Double-check how swath is being calculated when creating 2D cross-sections
- [ ] Finish tutorial
- [X] Finish installation instrunctions
- [X] Read EPcrust velocity model. 
- [ ] Sort out codes for making RF plots.
- [ ] Organise codes `compute_RF_migration_spher.py`
- [ ] Double-check back-azimuth changes along the theoretical wave path
- [ ] Compare results using EPcrust vs iasp91: 1) cross-sections 2) piercing points
- [ ] Plot cross-section (update the colormap scale)
